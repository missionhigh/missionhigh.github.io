# HACKING

## Mac

Open a Terminal and change to the directory where you've checked out
`missionbit.github.io`, then run this command to start the [Jekyll]
preview server:

```bash
jekyll serve --watch --safe
```

This will run a webserver on your computer at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
and automatically rebuild the site when you make changes to the files.
You will have to reload the pages in your browser to see the changes.
